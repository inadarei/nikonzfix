# Z6 & Z7 II NEF Fix Utility

Nikon recently released fabulous Z6 and Z7 mirrorless cameras. Unfortunately,
MacOS, LightRoom and Capture One all stopped being able to process the file,
due to silly signature change.

This nifty utility fixes that problem. Just run it in the folder where you have
your NEF files and - voila!

# Usage

1. Download the binary for your system from the [build folder](https://github.com/inadarei/nikonzfix/tree/main/build) where "zfix" is the one for Mac. 
2. Put the binary in the PATH variable for your system
3. Invoke the binary in any folder where you have NEF files, and it will
fix all the files in the folder.
4. Enjoy
